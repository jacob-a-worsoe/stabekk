## Exploration of dates

Two columns: *date_calc*, *date_forecast*. 

15 minute intervals. 

*date_calc* is the time at which the forecast is made always 7-8am day before *date_forecast*. Possible to look at time from forecast made as indicator of wheather reliability (maybe change the weighting of different models based on this weighting seasonality more or less as opposed to the forecasted weather features). For the time being we will not look at this.
